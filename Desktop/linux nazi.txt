LINUX NAZI - SONG BY POSMODERNIST1488 AKA Alexander Ivanov

Yo, will start my career with a banger
while my homeland's gettin' lot bigger

I remember raskolnikov and dostoevsky
I remember christians and my brother baginsky
but they never won't make me a liberal
as their funeral's becoming quite li[d]eral

be honest wicha
it ain't like weed
bein' a nazi (huh)
it's hell of a deed
    
a beta would never understand
when a sigma    creates new meta
becoming new alpha and omega
in the mackinder world of heart land 

thus goes the truth of 
a new type of nazi
windows and mac - shove
up your arses

my fascism is open source
fighting bloat everywhere it goes
unlike epstein's island of libs
I prefer another kind 
            that being C libs

everyone is not equal
what I want is the best ones to win
it is no miracle
considering what evolution has been


is it really something wrong to ask
because I don't think
that my logic is flawed
as this is basically what I was taught

let the best people win
and I hope that it's mine
cause the power of russian
we can't undermine

I think that i'm normal
primitive is not bad
it's just modern society 
dat [meydzhu] mad

it really is normal
to fight against something

that wants to fight you
if you don't understand it
you might need to suffer
then you might get it too

and it is no threat
as dostoyevsky said
you need to suffer
to really go upper

and believe me
my heart is hurting
I do suffer a lot
but my faith is the only thing that i've got

so if you really want to
call me a nazi 
call me a fascist
at the end of the day
I really am just a common-sense-ist
